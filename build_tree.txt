## after each family is separated into its own fasta file
## build a tree for each family

##### STEP 1: build tree #####

#raxml MPI is used since tree is built on a cluster
# -f d option (best scoring ML tree)
# -m GTRCAT (see: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.17.302505v1.abstract)
# -s input_file
# -n output_file
# -N thread_number
# -p random_seed

raxmlHPC-MPI -f d -m GTRCAT -s partition1.fasta -n sim1tree -N 10 -p 38492

##### STEP 2: find ancestral sequence ###
