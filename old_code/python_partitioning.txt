## after running partis to simulate and partition sequences
## partis puts all the simulated sequences and the naive (ancestral) sequences into 1 file
## use python to extract each family into its own file (separated from the naive)

##### Step 1: get input_seqs and naive_seqs #####
## naive and input sequences are separated
## the yaml file is from partis output

python yaml_to_families.py name2.yaml partitions.txt naive.txt

##### Step 2: 
# each family is moved into a separate file
python partition_to_fasta.py partitions.txt
