# after STEP 1: tree building
# search for the naive sequence

##### STEP 2: find ancestral sequence ###

# -f A option finds the ancestral sequences
# -t is the tree built in step 1 after polytomies are resolved

raxmlHPC-MPI -f A -t tree_small_no_polytomies.tree -m GTRCAT -s partition1.fasta -n sim1asr -N 2 -p 53985

##### STEP 3: compare ancestral sequences ###

#compare the root sequence from step 2 and the naive sequence from partis
